Footnotes
=========

.. [#element] The input for the `element class <#elements.Element>`_ is **not** case sensitive. It capitalizes strings for you.

.. [#semantic] Make sure you don't confuse the 1 (integer) with the 1.0 (float)! Periodic makes assumptions about what type of data you are giving it based on the type of the data.
